# Harper Cloud Demo

HarperDB is a SQL/NoSQL data management platform. It is fully indexed, doesn't duplicate data, and runs on any device- from the edge to the cloud.

It is built natively as a set of micro-services, making development and integration easy and seamless. HarperDB utilizes a single-endpoint for all operations. HarperDBâ€™s RESTful nature makes it stateless, stable, and scalable.
